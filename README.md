# bfs-haskell

A simple implementation of BFS in Haskell. Meant to solve a maze. Five sample mazes are in the "tst" folder. This specific implementation assumes a maze with open paths denoted by periods and walls denoted by hashtags. The shortest path is denoted by asterisks and will be shown on a new version of the maze printed to STDOUT.
